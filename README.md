Brain Game 🧠
Brain Game is a unique web-based reaction-time software built to detect early onset of Alzheimer's disease. The game is designed to test the reaction time of users based on a visual stimulus.

About 📖
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die, leading to a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills. Early detection of Alzheimer's can help manage symptoms and improve the quality of life of affected individuals and their caregivers.

Brain Game provides a platform for tracking reaction times and visualizing these times relative to the user's age and gender, which can be used as a tool in early detection of cognitive decline.

How It Works 🕹️
The user is presented with a simple interface asking for their name, age, and gender.
Once the "Start" button is clicked, a red circle, or the "Red Ball" as we fondly call it, will randomly appear and disappear on the screen.
The user's task is to click on the Red Ball as quickly as possible each time it appears.
The game consists of 10 rounds. After 10 rounds, the game ends and the user's average reaction time is recorded.
The recorded data is visualized in a scatter plot chart, showing reaction times versus age, with different colors representing different genders.
